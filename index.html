                    <p class="about__text text text_light">
                        My name is Daria Sharova.
                        I'm a professional and ambitious tattoo artist and painter
                        <br><br>
                        I'm one of the few in the world working in the tribal tattoo style. I've been tattooing for 11
                        years, and during this
                        time, I've developed my own unique style and achieved high quality in my work. I’ve been
                        studying
                        the cultures and
                        traditions of various peoples and tribes and integrating this knowledge into my art. This
                        artistic
                        expression extends
                        beyond tattoos to painting, clothing, and jewellery

                <p class="bio__text text text_dark">Thanks to my diligence and determination, I have had the
                    opportunity to
                    work at the best tattoo studios in Saint
                    Petersburg, alongside top Russian tattoo artists. I have been featured in tattoo magazines, given
                    lectures and seminars,
                    and participated in exhibitions and collaborations
                    <br><br>
                    Through my art, I aim to draw people's attention to the cultural heritage of tattooing. I believe
                    it's
                    important to
                    preserve these traditions and to raise awareness about the diversity of peoples and tribes, their
                    customs, and rituals.
                    Currently, I am based in Berlin, embarking on a new chapter of my life

                <li class="session__item text text_light">It is very important to get a good night's sleep before the
                    session. A healthy 7-9 hour sleep will help you to bear the
                    process more comfortable, and the body to recover faster.</li>
                <li class="session__item text text_light">You should eat well before the session, it will help to avoid
                    dizziness in the process, as well as nourish your body
                    with the necessary energy. I recommend bringing some snacks with you, especially sweets.</li>
                <li class="session__item text text_light">Loose and comfortable clothing will help to make sure that you
                    aren’t randomly getting itchy, overheated and it will
                    allow you to easily re-adjust your positioning in case you become uncomfortable. Make sure that your
                    clothing allows
                    easy access to the tattoo site and is fresh. You may bring a change of clothes/socks if necessary.
                </li>
                <li class="session__item text text_light">You should moisturize your skin 1-2 times a day with a
                    moisturizing cream for 7-10 days before the session. This will
                    ensure easy application of the ink.</li>
                <li class="session__item text">Drink a lot of water, it will make your skin hydrated and prepared for
                    your tattoo session. Hydrated skin takes ink a
                    lot better than dehydrated skin. And in general, drinking enough water is good for the body.</li>
                <li class="session__item text text_light">Think in advance about what will help you to not get bored at
                    the session. It can be your favorite music, series or book. Don't forget to take your headphones
                </li>
                <li class="session__item text text_light">It is forbidden to take alcohol and blood-thinning drugs
                    (aspirin) at least one day before the session. They can cause
                    profuse bleeding during work.</li>

                        larger than the size of the tattoo, ~5−10 cm in each side to avoid slippage. Let the compress be
                        slightly loose so that the body can move comfortably
                    </p>
                    <p class="healing__item-text text text_dark">You need to do this procedure three times per day.

                        moisturizer or lotion to use for another 2-4 weeks. Try to keep your tattoo moistened all the

                            a
                            disinfectant
                            solution and then cover with a disposable barrier
                            protection. All consumables are also disposable: needles, ink caps, cups, spatulas, razors,
                            wipes, barrier protection
                            for a tattoo machine and spray battle. The grip for the tattoo machine is disinfected and
                            sterilized.

                            I open the needles in the session in front of you.

                        <p class="faq__drop-text text text_dark">Mostly, a touch-up is not required, but the final
                            healing largely
                            depends
                            on the individual characteristics of the skin,
                            the functioning of the immune system, and a treatment. After a complete healing (1-1.5
                            months),
                            send me a photo of your
                            tattoo by email in daylight, then I can tell if a touch-up is needed in your case.

                            If it is needed, that's ok. It usually doesn't take long. Correction is free, only
                            consumables
                            are paid

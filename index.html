                    My name is Daria Sharova.
                    I'm a professional and ambitious tattoo artist and painter.
                    <br>
                    I'm one of the few in the world working in the tribal tattoo style. I've been tattooing for 11
                    years, and during this
                    time, I've developed my own unique style and achieved high quality in my work. I’ve been studying
                    the cultures and
                    traditions of various peoples and tribes and integrating this knowledge into my art. This artistic
                    expression extends
                    beyond tattoos to painting, clothing, and jewellery.

            <h2 class="bio__title">About me</h2>
            <p class="bio__text text text_color">Thanks to my diligence and determination, I have had the opportunity to
                work at the best tattoo studios in Saint
                Petersburg, alongside top Russian tattoo artists. I have been featured in tattoo magazines, given
                lectures and seminars,
                and participated in exhibitions and collaborations.

                Through my art, I aim to draw people's attention to the cultural heritage of tattooing. I believe it's
                important to
                preserve these traditions and to raise awareness about the diversity of peoples and tribes, their
                customs, and rituals.
                Currently, I am based in Berlin, embarking on a new chapter of my life.</p>

                I’m an explorer by nature.
                That is why the traditions and tattoos of different tribes and nations resonate with me incredibly.
                It's a limitless layer to explore.
                The more I learn, the more I understand how everything in the world is interconnected.
                And through ornaments I can see that connection.

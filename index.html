                    My name is Daria Sharova.
                    I'm a professional and ambitious tattoo artist and painter.
                    <br>
                    I'm one of the few in the world working in the tribal tattoo style. I've been tattooing for 11
                    years, and during this
                    time, I've developed my own unique style and achieved high quality in my work. I’ve been studying
                    the cultures and
                    traditions of various peoples and tribes and integrating this knowledge into my art. This artistic
                    expression extends
                    beyond tattoos to painting, clothing, and jewellery.

            <h2 class="bio__title">About me</h2>
            <p class="bio__text text text_color">Thanks to my diligence and determination, I have had the opportunity to
                work at the best tattoo studios in Saint
                Petersburg, alongside top Russian tattoo artists. I have been featured in tattoo magazines, given
                lectures and seminars,
                and participated in exhibitions and collaborations.

                Through my art, I aim to draw people's attention to the cultural heritage of tattooing. I believe it's
                important to
                preserve these traditions and to raise awareness about the diversity of peoples and tribes, their
                customs, and rituals.
                Currently, I am based in Berlin, embarking on a new chapter of my life.</p>

                I’m an explorer by nature.
                That is why the traditions and tattoos of different tribes and nations resonate with me incredibly.
                It's a limitless layer to explore.
                The more I learn, the more I understand how everything in the world is interconnected.
                And through ornaments I can see that connection.

        <h2 class="session__title">Preparation for a session</h2>
        <ul class="session__list">
            <li class="session__item text">It is very important to get a good night's sleep before the session. A
                healthy 7-9
                hour sleep will help you to bear the
                process more comfortable, and the body to recover faster.</li>
            <li class="session__item text">You should eat well before the session, it will help to avoid dizziness in
                the
                process, as well as nourish your body
                with the necessary energy. I recommend bringing some snacks with you, especially sweets.</li>
            <li class="session__item text">Loose and comfortable clothing will help to make sure that you aren’t
                randomly
                getting itchy, overheated and it will
                allow you to easily re-adjust your positioning in case you become uncomfortable. Make sure that your
                clothing allows
                easy access to the tattoo site and is fresh. You may bring a change of clothes/socks if necessary.
            </li>
            <li class="session__item text">You should moisturize your skin 1-2 times a day with a moisturizing cream for
                7-10
                days before the session. This will
                ensure easy application of the ink.</li>
            <li class="session__item text">Drink a lot of water, it will make your skin hydrated and prepared for your
                tattoo
                session. Hydrated skin takes ink a
                lot better than dehydrated skin. And in general, drinking enough water is good for the body.</li>
            <li class="session__item text">Think in advance about what will help you to not get bored at the session. It
                can
                be your favorite music, series or
                book. Don't forget to take your headphones</li>
            <li class="session__item text">It is forbidden to take alcohol and blood-thinning drugs (aspirin) at least
                one
                day before the session. They can cause
                profuse bleeding during work.</li>
